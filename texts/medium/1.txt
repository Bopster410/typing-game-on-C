I wake up in the morning and check the clock. It's already 9 AM and I'm running late! I grab my laptop and rush to work. As I'm sitting in the office, I start typing away on my keyboard. My fingers move quickly as I type in emails, forms, documents, and other pieces of text. Every now and then, I take a break and stretch my fingers. With my typing speed increasing, I'm getting closer to reaching my goals and becoming a master typist.
